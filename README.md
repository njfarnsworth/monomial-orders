# Reconstructing Monomial Orders

This repository contains the implementation of three programs
- ``arre_matrices.py``: calculates the number of unique ARRE structures for a monomial order in n variables, and prints all possible structures. 


The first determines whether any MORMORE (Monomial Order Represented by Matrices with Only Rational Entries) is reconstructible. The second determines whether a set of matrices corresponds to the induced orders of a MORMORE.
