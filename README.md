# Reconstructing Monomial Orders

This repository contains the implementation of three programs.
- ``arre_matrices.py``: Calculates the number of unique ARRE structures for a monomial order in n variables, and prints all possible structures.
- ``confirm_reconstructible.jl``: Determines whether any MORMORE (Monomial Order Represented by Matrices with Only Rational Entries) is reconstructible
- ``reconstruct_from_induced.jl``: Determines whether a set of matrices corresponds to the induced orders of a MORMORE.
