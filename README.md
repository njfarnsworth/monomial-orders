# Reconstructing Monomial Orders

This repository contains the implementation of two programs. The first determines whether any MORMORE (Monomial Order Represented by Matrices with Only Rational Entries) is reconstructible. The second determines whether a set of matrices corresponds to the induced orders of a MORMORE.
